Expectations:
- After learning how to use GitHub properly, I can already tell that the road ahead will not be smooth.
I can already see the possible mistakes of errors in syntax and having to double-double check if you're in
the right repository as well as if you're pushing to the right branch. Nevertheless, I can see myself enjoying
this experience as it will definitely help me get used to working with others especially with the handy feature
of being able to work with others through GitHub.
